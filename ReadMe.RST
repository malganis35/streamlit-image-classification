# Example of an Streamlit application
----------------------------------------------------

The objective of this application is to show a simple example of a streamlit application to classify Cars from Plane image

This script was inspired from the tutorial: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/create-image-classification-model-python-keras/

The data were downloaded from this google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbcWabr3Xrr4JvuG0VxTiweGzHn-YYvW/view


# How to use this code
----------------------------------------------------
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the necessary package
3. Go into the `\script` folder
4. (a) you can learn the model by using the script `classify.py`
4. (b) you can classify a new image using the streamlit interface by launching in command line `streamlit run image_recognition_streamlit.py`


# Organization
----------------------------------------------------
The project is organized in these different folders:
- data: contains the dataset for train and test for Cars and Planes
- images: contains the logo for the streamlit application
- script: contains the script to learn the model, for the streamlit application and a model learnt from the train dataset
